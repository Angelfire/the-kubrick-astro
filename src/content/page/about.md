Hello! I'm [Andr√©s Bedoya](https://srhart.co) I'm a Systems and Informatics Engineer and a dedicated JavaScript Developer with over 12 years of experience. My passion lies in creating engaging user interfaces and web applications using open-source technologies. Lately, I've been expanding my horizons into the backend world, enhancing my skills in Node.js and exploring serverless architectures with AWS.

I'm also well-versed in managing Linux and OS X systems, with a good grasp of web trends, basic server management, and computer information security.

Beyond coding, I'm an internet enthusiast and have been blogging since I was young. I love using technology to enhance communication, enjoy music, connect through networks, and improve daily life. I'm a firm believer in free culture and the power of technology to bring people together.
